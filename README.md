## Web Server and API 

### Web Server

* The primary role of a web server is to serve web pages for a website

* If you want to host your web application on the internet, in many cases you will need a web server.

* A web page can be rendered from a single HTML file, or a complex assortment of resources fitted 
together. (like JS, scripts, CSS, files, etc)

### Request-Response Model 

Client sends the data and server responds to the request with a response

### use cases for a web server 

* Servers HTML, CSS, and JS files
* Servers images and videos
* Handles HTTP error messaging
* Handles user requests, often concurrently
* Directs URL matching and rewriting
* Processes and servers dynamic content 

### API 

* API stands for **application programming interface**, which is a set of definitions and protocols 
for building and integrating application software.

* APIs let your product or service communnicate with other producst and services without having to 
know how they are implemented. Example - If yor application wants to have navigation feature, it can 
use Google Maps API. It doesn't have ti know how Google Maps API is implemented.

* This can simplify application development and save time and money.
